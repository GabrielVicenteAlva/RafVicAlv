        <h1>About</h1>
		<div class="about-div">
			<p>"R.A.M. the robot" is a webcomic about the day-to-day of R.A.M., a robotic Raccoon, and her friends as interplanetary mail carriers
			in the fantastic times of the 26th century.</br></br>
			
			After the Great Space War (2429-2434) new and better technologies were developed, managing to create faster and cheaper spaceships.
			Now travel between Earth and Mars only takes a week, in average.</br></br>
			Jake, after selling his first patent of one of his inventios, bought a ship. With his girlfriend they would use it to create an interplanetary delivery service to
			finance more crazy inventions. But this job did not give him enough free time to make new devices, so he hired someone to help him on
			the ship, although that didnt reduce his tasks very much. </br></br>
			After many trips between Earth and Mars Jake and Jeanette saved enough money to buy a robot.
			This robot was a R3-40 multitask robot which they named "Random Access Memory" (R.A.M.) Thanks to her,
			Jake had enough free time to be able to make inventions again which would lead the entire crew to crazy experiences.
